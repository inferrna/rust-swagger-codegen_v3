# Swagger v3.0 Codegen for the rust library

## Overview
This is a boiler-plate project to generate your own client library with Swagger.  Its goal is
to get you started with the basic plumbing so you can put in your own logic.  It won't work without
your changes applied.

## What's Swagger?
The goal of Swagger™ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.


Check out [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) for additional information about the Swagger project, including additional libraries with support for other languages and more. 

## How do I use this?
Use it as generated module as described here https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/3.0.0#making-your-own-codegen-modules

Now it's on very early stage. Tested only on https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/invest-openapi/blob/master/src/docs/swagger-ui/swagger.yaml
